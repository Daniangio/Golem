CORE: Permanent Upgrades & Tiers

Upgrades are earned at Reward Milestones (typically after Chapters 3, 6, and 9). They are assigned to specific players and remain for the rest of the campaign.

Tier 1 (Early Game: Consistency)

Thermal Buffer: Your Steam (White) cards always count as matching the Terrain suit for the purpose of the Draw Phase.

Stable Mix: When you play a Cinder (Red) card, you may treat its value as $\pm 1$.

Armor Polish: If you play a Stone (Brown) card and the group overshoots, you have a 50% chance (coin flip) to ignore the HP damage.

Tier 2 (Mid Game: Flexibility)

Prismatic Pulse: Your Jolly (Prism) cards can now be played as any Suit of your choice.

Kinetic Recycle: Once per Chapter, if the group Succeeds, you may take your played card back into your hand instead of discarding it.

Neural Overlap: Once per Chapter, you may swap your card with another player's card after both are revealed but before calculating the sum.

Tier 3 (Late Game: Survival)

Infinite Reservoir: Your Reservoir Swaps never cost Heat if the card you are putting into the Reservoir is a $0$.

Void Engine: Once per Chapter, you may ignore the Location Rule for a single Pulse.

Heart of the Golem: You gain a permanent $+1$ Hand Capacity. Additionally, your $10$ cards can be played as $0$ at your discretion.
