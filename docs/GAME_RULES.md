CORE: The Golem’s Journey

The Great Work of Ascension

CORE is a cooperative campaign game for 3 players. You inhabit the internal faculties of Adam Kadmon, a primordial Golem built of clay but destined for divinity. To achieve "Ascension," you must navigate the ten Spheres of the Decad (The Tree of Life), overcoming the material laws imposed by the Demiurge.

I. THE VITAL VESSELS (Game Components)

The Pulse Deck (60 Cards): * 5 Suits: Cinder (Red), Stone (Brown), Ether (Blue), Steam (White), Acid (Green).

Values: 0–10 in each suit (55 cards).

5 Prism (Jolly) Cards: Wild vibrations with variable ranges ($1-5$ or $6-10$).

Terrain Decks: Five difficulty-tiered decks ($15$ cards each) representing the Stability Windows of the material world.

The Golem Dashboard: Tracks Divine Spark (Starting at $5$) and Friction ($0-3$).

The Akashic Reservoir: A face-up card used for emergency swaps.

Faculties: Cards assigned to players at each location which modify his/her playstyle.

II. THE CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE

The journey to consciousness is not linear. It is a descent and subsequent climb through 10 Spheres (Stages).

1. The Branching Decad

Each Stage corresponds to a Sephira on the Tree of Life. At the start of a Stage, players must choose one location from a set of available paths.

Each location provides a unique Flavor, a Location Rule (modifier to base mechanics), and specifies the Compulsory (*) and Optional Faculties available for that chapter.

# THE TEN SPHERES OF ASCENSION

The Golem must ascend through the ten emanations of the Tree of Life to achieve consciousness.

Malkuth (The Kingdom): The physical world of matter and the starting point of the soul's journey.

Yesod (The Foundation): The sphere of dreams, the subconscious, and the bridge between worlds.

Hod (Splendor): The realm of cold logic, intellect, and the structured patterns of reason.

Netzach (Victory): The domain of raw emotions, passions, and the persistent drive of nature.

Tiphareth (Beauty): The center of balance and harmony, where the self meets the divine light.

Gevurah (Severity): The sphere of judgment, discipline, and the necessary constraints of justice.

Chesed (Mercy): The realm of expansion, compassion, and the boundless giving of the spirit.

Binah (Understanding): The cosmic mother and the matrix through which divine energy is shaped.

Chokmah (Wisdom): The point of pure intuition and the flash of original, creative insight.

Kether (The Crown): The source of all emanation and the final union with the divine Monad.

2. Faculty Assignment

Characters in CORE are fluid. At the start of a new Location:

Review the Compulsory Faculties (*) listed on the Location card. These must be assigned to players first.

Assign Optional Faculties so that each player has exactly one card assigned.

These cards remain with the player for the duration of that 5-Step Chapter, after which they are returned to the pool.

III. OFFICIAL RULES OF MANIFESTATION

1. The Pulse Sequence

Each Chapter consists of 5 Steps (Pulses). To win, the Golem must complete 5 Steps while maintaining at least 1 Divine Spark.

Terrain Reveal: Flip the current step's Terrain Card (e.g., Target: $12-16$, Suit: Steam).

Secret Selection: Each player plays 1 card from their hand face-down.

Reveal & Resolve: Sum all values ($V_{total}$).

Prism Cards: Values are chosen at resolution. The group selects values within the printed range to best fit the Stability Window.

Success: $V_{total}$ is within the window. The Vessel advances. All players refill hands.

The Overshoot (Pride): $V_{total} >$ Max. The Vessel loses $1$ Divine Spark. All players refill hands. The Vessel advances.

The Stall (Apathy): $V_{total} <$ Min. No Divine Spark is Lost. No one refills hands. The Vessel fails to move; the current Terrain remains for the next Pulse.

2. The Resonance Rule

If your card’s suit matches the Resonant Suit of the Terrain, you immediately refill your hand, regardless of success, overshoot, or stall.

3. The Akashic Swap

Once per Pulse, the group may perform a Swap:

Exchange: 1 played card is swapped with the Reservoir card to adjust $V_{total}$.

Friction: Each swap adds +1 Friction.

Surge: At 3 Friction, the Vessel takes 1 Damage and Friction resets to 0.

4. Desperation Surge

If a player has 0 cards during the Selection Phase, the Vessel takes 1 Damage. Every player immediately draws back to their Hand Capacity.

IV. SPHERES & LOCATIONS (Preview)

STAGE 1: Malkuth (The Kingdom of Dust)


V. EVOLUTION: PERMANENT ASCENSION

1. Permanent Modifiers (Sigils)

Every 2-3 stages, the Golem reaches a Reward Milestone. Reveal 3 Permanent Modifier Cards; the group selects one to assign to a specific player for the rest of the campaign.

Red Sigil: Treat Red card values as $\pm 1$.

Efficiency Sigil: First Reservoir Swap in a Chapter costs 0 Friction.

Recycle Sigil: Once per Chapter, pull a card from the discard pile into your hand.

2. Progression Note

As you ascend (Stages 4-10), the Terrain Decks become narrower and the Location Rules more severe. Use your permanent modifiers to stabilize the Golem's increasing volatility.

VI. TECHNICAL NOTES

Reshuffle: If the Pulse Deck is empty, shuffle the discard pile.

Failure Loop: On a Stall, the same Terrain card stays. You must overcome it in the next Pulse using your remaining cards.
