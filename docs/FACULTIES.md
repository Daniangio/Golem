CORE: Golem Module Catalog

In CORE, players do not play fixed characters. Instead, at the start of each Location, players distribute "Parts" among themselves. Each player must have exactly one Part. Some are Compulsory (*) (required by the narrative/environment), while others are Optional (chosen by the group to balance their build).

1. Tactical Modules (Information & Control)

Sharp Eye: Passive. This player may secretly inspect the 5 Terrain cards of the current Chapter at any time, including before the reveal phase.

Chronometer: Passive. This player may look at the top card of the Pulse Deck.

Signal Flare: Once per Chapter, after the reveal, this player can declare the Suit of the next Terrain card.

2. Power Modules (Numerical Manipulation)

Auxiliary Battery: Once per Chapter, after the reveal, this player may contribute one additional card from their hand to the Pulse.

Fuse: Once per Chapter, after the reveal, this player may choose one played card (theirs or an ally's) and reduce its value to 0 for that Pulse.

Heavy Chassis: Passive. This player’s cards always count as $+2$ value. This is often a burden in low-range stages but a boon in high-range climbs.

Overclocker: Active. This player can play 2 cards instead of 1 during the selection phase, but doing so generates $+1$ Heat.

3. Structural & Utility Modules (Survival)

Reinforced Hull: Passive. The first time the Golem would take Damage in a Chapter, ignore it.

Cooling Fan: Passive. When this player plays a Steam (White) card, it reduces Heat by an additional $1$ point.

Magnetic Grasp: Active. At the start of a Pulse, this player may swap one card from their hand with the current Reservoir card for $0$ Heat.

4. Constraint Modules (Compulsory Burdens)

Numb Leg (*): Passive. The assigned player’s hand capacity is permanently reduced by $1$ for this Chapter.

Static Core (*): Passive. The assigned player cannot use the passive effects of their card suits.

Muddled Sensors (*): Passive. The assigned player must play their card face-down before the Terrain card for the Step is revealed.

Cracked Pistons (*): Passive. If the group Undershoots, this player takes an additional $-1$ to their hand capacity for the next step.
