Game for 3 players.

1. Game Components
The Pulse Deck (60 Cards): * 5 Suits: Cinder (Red), Stone (Brown), Ether (Blue), Steam (White), Acid (Green). Values: $0$ to $10$ in each suit ($55$ cards) plus $5$ Prism (Jolly) cards with a variable range ($1-5$ or $6-10$).
Terrain Decks: Five difficulty-tiered decks ($15$ cards each) containing "Stability Windows" (Target Ranges).
The Golem Dashboard: Tracks Structural Integrity (5 HP) and Heat ($0-3$).
The Reservoir: A single face-up card used for emergency swaps (can be multiple cards if some locations specify so).
Module Cards: Permanent character-like upgrades assigned to players after specific milestones.

2. Core Gameplay Mechanics
Each Chapter consists of $5$ "Steps" (Pulses).
A Chapter is successful if the Golem maintains at least $1$ HP.
The Pulse Sequence
- Terrain Reveal: Flip the current step's Terrain Card (e.g., Target: $12-16$, Suit: Steam).
- Secret Selection: Each player plays $1$ card face-down.
- Reveal & Resolve: Sum all values ($V_{total}$).
    Success: $V_{total}$ is within the window. Everyone draws back up to their hand capacity.
    Overshoot: $V_{total} >$ Max. The Golem takes $1$ Damage. Everyone draws back up to their hand capacity.
    Undershoot: $V_{total} <$ Min. No damage is taken, but no one draws cards. Hand sizes shrink, reducing future choices.

Prism (Jolly) Cards: Their value is chosen at **resolution time**, within their printed range ($1-5$ or $6-10$). By default, choose the value(s) that best match the current Terrain window.

The Matching Rule: If a player’s card suit matches the Terrain Card’s suit, that player immediately draws back to their full hand capacity, regardless of whether the group overshot or undershot.
The Reservoir & Heat: Each Pulse, the group may perform a Reservoir Swap:
    Action: Exchange $1$ played card for the Reservoir card to hit the target range.
    Cost: $+1$ Heat.
    Surge: At $3$ Heat, the Golem takes $1$ Damage and Heat resets to $0$.

The Pulse Deck Reshuffle: If the Pulse Deck runs out of cards, shuffle the entire discard pile and use it as the new deck.

After resolve, if it was a Success, the next Terrain card is revealed. Otherwise, the same terrain card remains on the table and players
move to Secret Selection phase.
If at any moment one player has no cards in hand during the Secret Seleciton Phase, the Golem takes $1$ damage and Everyone draws back up to their hand capacity.

3. Dynamic Golem Parts (Characters)
Unlike fixed roles, Golem parts are selected at the start of each Location.
Locations specify which parts are Compulsory (must be taken) and which are Optional.
Compulsory Parts (Example: "Numb Leg"): The assigned player has a hand capacity of $4$ instead of $5$.
Advantageous Parts (Example: "Sharp Eye"): The player may secretly inspect all $5$ Terrain cards for the current Chapter at the start of Step 1.
Balanced Parts (Example: "Overclocker"): The player can play $2$ cards instead of $1$, but doing so generates $+1$ Heat.

4. The Campaign & Permanent Evolution
The journey lasts $10$ Chapters.
Progression is managed through Environmental Modifiers.
Permanent Modifiers: Every $2-3$ stages (specified on location cards), a "Reward Milestone" occurs. Players reveal $3$ Permanent Modifier Cards and select $1$ to assign to a specific player for the remainder of the campaign.
Red (Fuel) Modifier: "When you play a Red card, you may treat its value as $\pm1$.
"Efficiency Modifier: "Your first Reservoir Swap in a Chapter costs $0$ Heat.
"Recycle Modifier: "Once per Chapter, you may take a card from the discard pile into your hand.

Location Rewards
Completing a stage grants immediate boons based on the chosen path:
Repair Station: Heal $1$ HP or reset Heat to $0$.
Supply Cache: Gain $1$ Mulligan Token (Shared: discard $X$ cards and draw $X$).
