CORE: Player Count Calibration

To ensure the Golem’s journey is balanced for different group sizes, apply the following refinements to the Base Rules.

1. The Stability Offset (Range Calibration)

Modify the printed Target Range on Terrain cards based on the number of players ($N$).

Player Count

Range Adjustment

Example (Base 8-22)

2 Players

Each plays 2 cards; Offset $+5$

$13 - 27$

3 Players

Baseline; Offset $0$

$8 - 22$

4 Players

Offset $+5$

$13 - 27$

5 Players

Offset $+10$

$18 - 32$

2. Hand Capacity & Choice

2-Player Mode (The Duo): Because each player must cover the output of two limbs, they play 2 cards per Pulse. To compensate for the faster exhaustion, their Hand Capacity is 8 (instead of 5).

3-5 Players: Hand Capacity remains 5.

3. The Match Bonus Scaling (Suit Resonance)

To prevent the Golem from becoming "self-healing" with too many players, the refill rule is adjusted:

2-3 Players: One matching suit refills that player's hand.

4-5 Players: Two or more players must match the Terrain suit for the bonus to trigger. If only one player matches, they do not refill their hand on a failure.

4. Module Distribution

2 Players: Each player is assigned 2 Modules (Total 4).

3-5 Players: Each player is assigned 1 Module (Total 3, 4, or 5).

Note: In 5-player games, ensure all "Compulsory" parts are assigned first; remaining players choose from the "Optional" pool.
