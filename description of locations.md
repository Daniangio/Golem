First three Location Cards of your campaign. These locations utilize the Level 1 Terrain Deck (range 8-22 with wide ranges) but introduce unique constraints and parts that redefine how the players interact with the Golem and each other.

Location Card Structure
Every Location Card in CORE contains the following elements:
    - Level Deck: The difficulty tier of the $5$ Terrain cards used.
    - Compulsory Parts (*): Modules that must be assigned to players for this stage.
    - Optional Parts: Additional modules the group can distribute to aid their success. Note that each player must have exactly 1 part assigned.
    - Location Rule: A unique mechanical shift active only for this Chapter.
    - Reward: The boon granted upon successful completion of the $5$ steps.


Location 1: The Scrapheap Awakening
"The Golem stirs amidst the rusted remains of its predecessors. Systems are coming online, but the frame is stiff and uncoordinated."

Level Deck: 1 (Ranges: $8$ to $22$)
Compulsory Parts (*):
    - Static Core (*): The assigned player cannot use the passive effect of their card suits.
    - Numb Leg (*): The assigned player’s hand capacity is reduced to $4$ cards.
Optional Parts:
    - Auxiliary Battery: Once per Chapter, the player may contribute an extra card to a Pulse after the reveal.
    - Fuse: Once per Chapter, the player may ignore the value of a played card in a Pulse after the reveal.

Location Rule (System Warm-up): The first Undershoot of this Chapter does not penalize the draw phase; the Golem is still finding its momentum.
Reward (Self-Repair): Heal the Golem for $1$ HP (Max $5$).

Location 2: The Whispering Mire
"A thick, acidic fog clings to the Golem’s joints. Visibility is low, and every step requires precise thermal management to avoid a meltdown."

Level Deck: 1 (Ranges: $8$ to $22$)
Compulsory Parts (*):
    - Numb Leg (*): The assigned player’s hand capacity is reduced to $4$ cards.
    - Muddled Sensors (*): The assigned player must play their first card face-down before the Terrain card for the next Step is revealed.
Optional Parts:
    - Cooling Fan: When this player plays a Steam (White) card, it reduces Heat by $1$.

Location Rule (Acidic Haze): Player cannot refill their hand if they play an Acid (Green) card, even if the group succeeds or they match the suit.
Reward (Self-Repair): Heal the Golem for $1$ HP (Max $5$).

Location 3: The Shattered Ascent
"The path turns vertical. Gravity is a constant enemy, and the Golem must divert all power to its pistons to clear the jagged peaks."

Level Deck: 1 (Ranges: $8$ to $22$)
Compulsory Parts (*):
    - Cracked Pistons (*): If the group Undershoots, this player takes an additional $-1$ to their hand capacity for the next step.
    - Heavy Chassis (*): This player’s cards always count as $+2$ value, making it harder to avoid overshooting.
Optional Parts:
    - Sharp Eye: This player may secretly inspect the $5$ Terrain cards in the Chapter deck at each moment, even before the reveal.
    - Auxiliary Battery: Once per Chapter, the player may contribute an extra card to a Pulse after the reveal.
    - Fuse: Once per Chapter, the player may ignore the value of a played card in a Pulse after the reveal.

Location Rule (Gravitational Pull): If no player matches the Terrain suit during a Pulse, the group must immediately add $+1$ Heat as the Golem struggles to maintain its position.
Reward (Self-Repair): Heal the Golem for $1$ HP (Max $5$).
Reward (Mulligan Token): Gain a shared token that allows one player to discard their entire hand and draw back to capacity at any time.
